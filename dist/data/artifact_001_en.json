  "history": "Wat Phou (Vat Phu) is a Khmer-Hindu temple complex in Champasak, southern Laos, with a long history dating back to the 2nd century BCE through the 13th century CE. Originally dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva at the sacred mountain of Phou Khao, the main structures were built between the 11th and 13th centuries and later adapted for Theravada Buddhist use. The site is renowned for its intricately carved lintels depicting Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, and other Hindu iconography, which remain revered to this day. The Buddha statue is now restored and exhibited at the Champasak Provincial Museum, which houses over 200 sculptural artifacts and stone inscriptions dating from the 11th to 18th centuries.
